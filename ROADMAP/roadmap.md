# SnowcrashAI Foundation — Public Roadmap (12 Months)

> **Audience:** Security practitioners and AI pentesters  
> **Scope:** Directional roadmap. Items indicate focus areas, not delivery commitments.

---

## Q1 — Consolidation & Trust
*Make v0.1 real, usable, and governable for practitioners.*

- Clarify maintainer authority and contribution workflows to ensure safe, non-weaponized collaboration.
- Stabilize v0.1 artifacts based on early practitioner feedback (clarifications only; no scope expansion).
- Improve cross-linking between risks, playbooks, architectures, and assurance concepts to reduce friction during use.

---

## Q2 — Coverage Expansion
*Broaden attack coverage using the established SnowcrashAI method.*

- Add a small number of new pentesting playbooks following the v0.1 structure (clear threat model, safe test steps, defensive linkage).
- Introduce concrete example scenarios for selected Top 10 risks without changing the taxonomy.
- Refine adversarial techniques documentation to reflect real-world AI system failure modes.

---

## Q3 — Assurance & Evidence
*Turn testing outcomes into defensible security evidence.*

- Define practitioner-oriented assurance guidance focused on test evidence, not compliance checklists.
- Map selected SnowcrashAI risks and controls to external frameworks (e.g., AI risk management standards) in a non-prescriptive way.
- Publish example evidence artifacts that pentesters can hand off to architects and risk teams.

---

## Q4 — Operationalization
*Show how SnowcrashAI is applied in real engagements.*

- Document end-to-end AI pentesting workflows using SnowcrashAI artifacts.
- Provide reference engagement patterns for common AI system types (RAG systems, agentic workflows, enterprise assistants).
- Update reference architectures to reflect operational lessons learned from testing.

---

## Roadmap Notes

- SnowcrashAI evolves iteratively; roadmap items may be refined based on practitioner feedback.
- The foundation remains vendor-neutral and methodology-driven.
- Expansion prioritizes depth and rigor over breadth.

---

## Status

- **Current release:** v0.1 (pre-release)  
- **Next milestone:** Directional expansion based on RM-1 themes
