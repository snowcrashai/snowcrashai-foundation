# Conflict of Interest (COI) and Transparency

SnowcrashAI Foundation is a community initiative. Trust depends on clear separation between open standards and commercial interests.

## Disclosures

Contributors and maintainers should disclose relevant conflicts when they:
- Propose content that references a product, vendor, or service they are affiliated with
- Are employed by or advising an organization that could benefit from the guidance
- Have financial interests that could be perceived as influencing recommendations

Disclosures may be made in:
- Pull request descriptions
- Issue comments
- A short note in the document where appropriate

## No endorsements

SnowcrashAI does not endorse vendors, products, or services.
- Comparative claims ("best", "most secure") should be avoided.
- If examples are needed, provide multiple options or keep examples generic.

## Separation from commercial offerings

Commercial entities may reference SnowcrashAI standards and contribute improvements back to the community, but they may not:
- Restrict access to SnowcrashAI core artifacts
- Present SnowcrashAI guidance as exclusive to a commercial product or service
- Use contributor influence to steer standards toward proprietary outcomes

## Stewardship and decision-making

SnowcrashAI Foundation is stewarded by its founder and governed through open contribution and transparent review.
- Major changes should be proposed via issue and reviewed before acceptance.
- Maintainers should recuse themselves from decisions where they have a direct conflict.

## Reporting concerns

If you believe a conflict of interest is not properly disclosed or is impacting content quality, raise it via a GitHub issue with a clear description and supporting context.
