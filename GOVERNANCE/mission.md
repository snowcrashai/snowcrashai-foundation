# Mission

SnowcrashAI Foundation is an open, practitioner-led initiative focused on the security, testing, and assurance of artificial intelligence systems.

## What we do

We produce and maintain:
- **Open standards** for AI system security
- **Practical pentesting and red-teaming playbooks** for AI/ML/LLM systems
- **Secure reference architectures** and defensive patterns for AI deployments
- **Research-backed guidance** for monitoring, assurance, and risk management of AI behavior

## What we do not do

To stay focused and credible, SnowcrashAI Foundation does not operate as:
- A vendor marketing channel or product directory
- A paywalled standards body
- An ethics-only or policy-only forum
- A vulnerability disclosure program (VDP) or bug bounty platform

## Intended outcomes

SnowcrashAI aims to help practitioners:
- Identify and validate real AI attack paths
- Build defensive controls that work in production
- Improve security posture through shared community knowledge
- Establish repeatable assurance practices for AI behavior over time
