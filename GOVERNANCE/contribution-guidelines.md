## How to contribute

### 1. Open an issue first (recommended)
Before large changes:
- Open a GitHub issue describing the proposal
- Include scope, motivation, and expected outcome
- Reference related SnowcrashAI artifacts if applicable

This helps avoid duplicate or misaligned work.

### 2. Create a pull request (PR)
When submitting a PR:
- Keep changes focused and scoped
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference the related issue (if one exists)

## Formatting and structure

- All documents are written in **Markdown**
- Follow existing document structure and headings
- Use clear, concise language suitable for practitioners
- Avoid unnecessary jargon or hype

## Versioning

Major artifacts (e.g., Top 10 lists, playbooks) are versioned.
- Breaking or significant changes should increment the version
- Minor clarifications may be merged without version changes
- Version changes should be noted in the relevant document or changelog

## Attribution and disclosures

- Contributors should add their name or handle if they wish to be credited
- Any potential conflict of interest must be disclosed (see `conflict-of-interest.md`)
- Contributions are made under the repository’s open license

## Review process

- Maintainers review contributions for scope, clarity, and alignment
