# Principles

SnowcrashAI Foundation follows these principles to preserve trust and usefulness:

## 1. Open and accessible
All core standards, playbooks, and reference architectures are publicly available.

## 2. Vendor-neutral
SnowcrashAI does not endorse specific vendors or products. Guidance is written to be portable across platforms.

## 3. Practitioner-driven
Materials are designed for hands-on use by security engineers, red teamers, blue teamers, and defenders operating real systems.

## 4. Evidence-based
Claims and recommendations should be supported by reproducible methodology, references, or operational experience.

## 5. Security-first scope
SnowcrashAI prioritizes practical security outcomes (risk reduction, detection, resilience) over hype, speculation, or broad ethics debates.

## 6. Balanced offense and defense
We document both how attacks work and how to mitigate and detect them. Playbooks must include defensive guidance.

## 7. Transparent stewardship
Decision-making, reviews, and major changes are done in the open via issues and pull requests when possible.

## 8. Safe publishing
We avoid publishing content that meaningfully enables wrongdoing. When describing attack techniques, we focus on defensive testing, controls, and risk context.

## 9. Versioned artifacts
Major standards and playbooks are versioned and changes are tracked to support auditability and long-term adoption.

## 10. Community respect
We welcome diverse viewpoints and maintain a professional, constructive environment for collaboration.
