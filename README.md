# SnowcrashAI Foundation

**SnowcrashAI Foundation** is an open, practitioner-led initiative focused on the security, testing, and assurance of artificial intelligence systems.

Our mission is to define how AI systems are **attacked, defended, and governed in real-world environments**, across design, training, deployment, and operations.

## Scope

SnowcrashAI focuses on:
- AI and ML system security
- Large Language Model (LLM) threats and defenses
- AI pentesting and red-teaming methodologies
- Secure reference architectures for AI systems
- Detection, monitoring, and assurance of AI behavior

We emphasize **practical security outcomes**, not abstract ethics or marketing claims.

- **Open and vendor-neutral**
- **Practitioner-driven**
